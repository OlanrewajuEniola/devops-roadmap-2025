## DevOps Roadmap 2025
just this bit
Welcome to my personal DevOps learning journey!

This repository documents the hands-on projects, scripts, and tools Iâ€™m using as I transition from IT Support into a **job-ready DevOps Engineer** by **September 2025**. Iâ€™m focusing on real-world skills, automation, and cloud-native tooling.


This project is part of my transformation from an IT Support Technician into a confident and capable DevOps Engineer. I created this roadmap to bring structure and consistency to my learning, with clear weekly goals and practical deliverables.

---

My strategy is project-based: I focus on one area at a time, such as Git, Docker, or Jenkins, and build hands-on scripts or automation around it. Everything I do is version-controlled and documented in this repository â€” not only to reinforce my learning but also to serve as a portfolio for recruiters and employers.

By September 2025, I aim to be fully job-ready with a solid grasp of DevOps fundamentals, tools, and best practices used in real-world teams.
