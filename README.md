# DevOps Roadmap 2025

Welcome to my personal DevOps learning journey!

This repository documents the hands-on projects, scripts, and tools I’m using as I transition from IT Support into a **job-ready DevOps Engineer** by **September 2025**. I’m focusing on real-world skills, automation, and cloud-native tooling.
